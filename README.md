I thought defunkt's pjax example was cool: <https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax/tree/heroku>
Just for fun thought it would be interesting to enable Padrino on top of Sinatra to clean up the example...

As seen on <http://padrino-pjax.heroku.com/>.

Check out
[layout.erb](https://github.com/nesquena/padrino-pjax/blob/master/app/views/layout/application.erb)
and
[pjax.rb](https://github.com/nesquena/padrino-pjax/blob/master/app/app.rb).
